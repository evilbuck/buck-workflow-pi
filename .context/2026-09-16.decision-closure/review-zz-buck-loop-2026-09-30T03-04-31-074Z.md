## Plan Path Review: Phase 2 — Shared Protocol

**Verdict: Pass.** The prior review’s in-plan finding is resolved: `skills/_shared/decision-closure.md:42` now requires assumption IDs to be unique within the artifact. The canonical and bundled copies are identical.

| Phase 2 deliverable | Status | Current-state evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Loadable protocol and registration | ✅ Complete | `skill://_shared/decision-closure.md` resolves; `skills/_shared/SKILL.md:17` registers it. |
| Conditional closure, assumption, risk, reframing, pressure, and hard-mode rules | ✅ Complete | `skills/_shared/decision-closure.md:5-92`, including the ID, status, blocking, and validation rules at lines 36–49. |
| Bundle and content constraints | ✅ Complete | Full-directory `diff -rq` returned no differences; the case-insensitive forbidden-term scan found no matches. Comparison with the cited donor sections found no complete copied sentence, table, template, or branded label. |

**Review axes:** Spec worst finding: none. Standards worst finding: none in the sequential fallback pass using the general review guides and the relevant duplication and speculative-generality entries. No cross-axis ranking.

**Guardrails:** Docs-only changes; the deterministic code check is skipped under the repository contract. No runtime behavior is claimed as tested. The phase’s shared-resource loading and bundle checks were exercised.

**Issue classification:** No remaining in-plan or out-of-plan issues. No immediate how-to impact; the workflow narrative is assigned to Phase 6. The earlier *Needs work* report describes the pre-iteration state, not this verdict.

**Next:** The supervisor can proceed with Phase 2 closeout. This assignment created or modified no files, so it staged none; pre-existing staged changes were left untouched.
