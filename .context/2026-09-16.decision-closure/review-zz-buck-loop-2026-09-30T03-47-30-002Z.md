## Phase 4 review: Pass

The in-plan findings from the previous review are resolved. `b-plan` now records Decision Closure whenever a material trigger applies, even if existing evidence settles the decision (`skills/b-plan/SKILL.md:244-252`). It leaves assumption-to-phase assignment to `b-phase`, which assigns one earliest-capable validation owner and adds HARD dependencies only where later work is unsafe (`skills/b-phase/SKILL.md:126-135`).

| Acceptance area | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Conditional closure and low-risk skip | Complete | `skills/b-plan/SKILL.md:244-254` |
| Assumption IDs, statuses, validation paths and material risks | Complete | `skills/b-plan/SKILL.md:248-252`; shared protocol |
| Missing grill closeout and confirmed reframing | Complete | `skills/b-plan/SKILL.md:248-249` |
| Earliest-capable phase ownership and dependent-work gates | Complete | `skills/b-phase/SKILL.md:126-135` |
| Bundle parity and content constraints | Complete | Both canonical directories match their Codex copies; prohibited whole-word scan found no matches. Compared the changed wording with the cited donor sections; no complete donor sentence, table, template or branded label was found. |

**Review axes:** Spec worst finding: none. Standards worst finding: none (sequential fallback; no background `task` tool available). No cross-axis ranking. No in-plan or out-of-plan issues found.

**Verification:** The focused Codex packaging test passed **7/7**. The reviewed changes are Markdown-only, so the deterministic code guardrails gate was skipped under the docs-only rule. No how-to impact; the methodology narrative is assigned to Phase 6.

No files were created or modified in this review, so there were no assignment files to stage. The pre-existing staged changes were left untouched. **Next:** close the accepted Phase 4 work through the workflow checkpoint; continue with the separately scoped Phase 5.
