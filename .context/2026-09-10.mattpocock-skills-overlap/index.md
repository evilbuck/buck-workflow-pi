# mattpocock/skills overlap audit

Read-only audit of `github.com/mattpocock/skills` (@ `3cca18b`, 37 skills) against this repo's
54 canonical skills. Produces an overlap classification, a provenance finding, and an adoption plan.

## Artifacts

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `research-mattpocock-skills-overlap.md` | Durable findings: provenance, overlap matrix, load-bearing differences, adoption plan |
| `../../presentations/2026-09-10.mattpocock-skills-overlap/index.html` | Full HTML report (deliverable) |

## Outcome

- **2 repo defects found**, independent of any adoption:
  1. `skills/b-grill-with-docs/{CONTEXT,ADR}-FORMAT.md` are near-verbatim upstream copies with no attribution.
  2. `b-issue-create` and `fix-pr` read `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` / `triage-labels.md`, which do not exist
     and which no skill produces.
- **9 genuine capability gaps**; largest is no debugging skill at all (`diagnosing-bugs`).
- **11 duplicate/strong overlaps**; the workflow spine should not be ported — ours is deeper at every station.
- **10 recommended adoptions**, classified as loop patches / new loop members / standalone references.

No source code, skills, or workflow files were modified.
