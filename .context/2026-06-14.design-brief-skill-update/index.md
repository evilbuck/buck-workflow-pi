# design-brief skill update

## Goal
Make `skills/design-brief/SKILL.md` agent-agnostic, broaden its accepted inputs to screenshots/files/text/session context, and constrain its Buck workflow awareness to inspecting `.context/<subject>/` when that subject exists.

## Outcome
- `skills/design-brief/SKILL.md` now uses standard skill frontmatter (`name`, `description`).
- The skill accepts screenshots, files, plain-language descriptions, session context, and optional subject-folder artifacts as sources for one normalized UI brief.
- Subject awareness is narrowed to `.context/<subject>/` artifacts only, instead of broader plan-stitching behavior.
- `README.md` skill catalog now lists `design-brief`.

## Artifacts
- `skills/design-brief/SKILL.md`
- `README.md`
- `plan-design-brief-skill-update.md`
- `.context/memory/design-brief-skill-update-2026-06-14.md`
