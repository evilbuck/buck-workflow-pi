**Needs work — one in-plan decision-tracking defect.** All three explicit Phase 1 acceptance checks pass.

- **Spec axis:** `.context/2026-10-01.skill-command-viability/plan-viability-cleanup.md:115` still marks D1 unchecked and `recommended`, despite the completed phase and verified removal. Set D1 to checked / `done` and record its passed checks; leave other items unchanged.
- **Standards axis:** no implementation findings. Reviewed separately using the sequential fallback.

**Verification:** all six paths absent, including dangling symlinks; six-step audit preserved at `docs/buck-workflow.md:138–158`; mirror suite **4/4 passed**. Durable guardrails **pass**, coverage **88.2%** against **84%** baseline; patch gate advisory, lint and functional gates skipped.

**Non-blocking documentation impact:** root `AGENTS.md` still advertises the deleted stubs; recommend `/b-docs`.

Full review and fix proposal written and staged:
`.context/2026-10-01.skill-command-viability/iterate-omp-stubs.md`

Only that new artifact was staged by this assignment. Recommended next action: `/b-iterate`, then re-review. No loop-state change or commit performed.
