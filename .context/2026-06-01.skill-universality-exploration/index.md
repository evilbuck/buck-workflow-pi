# Skill Universality Exploration

Exploration of making buck-workflow skills universal across Pi, Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, and OMP (oh-my-pi).

## Artifacts

- [research-universal-skills.md](research-universal-skills.md) — Full findings

## Key Findings

1. **Skills are already portable** — SKILL.md format is compatible across all agents
2. **Prompts are Pi-specific** — `$ARGUMENTS` syntax is unique to Pi
3. **Extensions are agent-specific** — Runtime automation requires agent hooks
4. **Adapter layer needed** — Command files for each agent to invoke skills

## Remaining Work

- [ ] Create `adapters/` directory structure
- [ ] Write agent command files (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex)
- [ ] Create installation script
- [ ] Update documentation for multi-agent installation
- [ ] Test in each agent
