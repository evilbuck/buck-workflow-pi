# Standalone B-Plan Bootstrap

## Goal
Make B-Plan useful when installed by itself, detect whether the active agent session has the full Buck Workflow available, and provide a safe GitHub installation or repair handoff when it does not.

## Artifacts
- [plan-standalone-b-plan-bootstrap.md](./plan-standalone-b-plan-bootstrap.md) — completed implementation plan
- [standalone-b-plan-bootstrap-build-2026-08-12.md](../memory/standalone-b-plan-bootstrap-build-2026-08-12.md) — completed build record

## Key Decision
“Mini subset” means the durable planning slice only: context inspection, necessary clarification, subject-folder creation, and an implementation-ready plan. B-Plan does not emulate build, review, save, documentation, or commit skills when the full workflow is absent.
