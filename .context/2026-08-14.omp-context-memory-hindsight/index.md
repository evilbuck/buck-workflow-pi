title: OMP native memory + b-memory-import + b-save
---

# OMP context memory × Hindsight

## Summary

Replaced qmd-first session search/save assumptions with a two-layer model: git-portable `.context/memory` plus optional OMP harness LTM (`retain`/`recall`/`reflect`). Added deterministic `b-memory-import` for bulk Hindsight backfill. Updated b-save (12 steps), bootstrap, README, AGENTS, and buck-workflow docs.

## Artifacts

- Session memory: `../memory/omp-context-memory-hindsight-2026-08-14.md`
- Importer: `../../skills/b-memory-import/`

## User Goal

Agents on OMP/Hindsight should search and checkpoint via native memory tools while keeping `.context/` as the reviewable multi-harness record; qmd is optional only.
