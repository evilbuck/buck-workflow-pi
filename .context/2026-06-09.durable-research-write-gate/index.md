# Durable Research Write-Gate Protocol

Enforce immediate write-gates in `b-explore` and `b-research` skills so findings are persisted incrementally rather than hoarded in context until session end.

## What Changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `skills/b-explore/SKILL.md` | Soft "Persistence" → **Write-Gate Protocol (Required)**; added `research/` subdirectory to creation steps |
| `skills/b-research/SKILL.md` | "Incremental Notes (Optional)" → **Incremental Notes (Required)**; soft "Incremental Research Behavior" → **Write-Gate Protocol (Required)** |

## Write-Gate Protocol (both skills)

1. Create `research/` subdirectory immediately after subject folder
2. Write rolling notes after each discovery unit (each code trace for explore, each source for research)
3. Consolidate rolling notes into canonical `research-<topic>.md` every 3–5 findings/sources
4. Update `index.md` after each consolidation
5. Do NOT wait until session end
