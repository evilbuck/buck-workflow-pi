# PR #58 fix-batch review

## Plan source and scope

Fix every validated CI/Wooderson claim on `evilbuck/buck-workflow-pi:feat/review-severity-ranking`, using native TypeSafe Jev and current source/runtime evidence. Review baseline is the original PR head above. Product diff: SQL save directive/fixtures; shared scan/diagnosis/ranking lifecycle; two semantic regressions; removal of synthetic rollback tests; accurate docs comments and changelog. No runtime score, waterline, retry, receipt-provenance or chooser policy changed.

## Completion matrix

| Contract | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Exhaustive pinned-head feedback, all claims accounted for | complete | Registered tool inventory: five candidate IDs; split-claim validation table in memory. |
| Native TypeSafe Jev on Wooderson claims | complete | `research-pr-58-jev.json`: model `jev-1.13.0`, code-evidence questions/answers; compound causal claims split. No chat fallback. |
| CI fixture identity, no production guard weakening | complete | Local fixture email; corrected directive caller; full test gate passes with global/system Git config disabled. |
| Shared unfinished-artifact lifecycle, every caller migrated | complete | `unfinishedIterates` moved to scan; one predicate uses `readStatus`; no compatibility re-export; raw discovery helper private. CRLF regression red-before/green-after; actual scan+diagnosis smoke passed. |
| Missing insert id cannot mint a receipt | complete | Specific refusal and receipt-absence assertions; disabling guard fails regression; policy-denied statement mutation also fails this test before reaching expected refusal. Production restored. |
| R-1 real rollback recovery, not a self-created graph | complete | Isolated copy of actual production source: remove review-to-rank edge/ranking state, restore iterate guard and review-time ceiling. Actual copied `next` routes to iterate, blocks at ceiling and preserves docs path. Scratch removed. |
| Required deterministic checks and full suites | complete | Durable v2 guardrails passes after standards edits; 89.3% against 84%; no new complexity/hard-ceiling violations. Full Vitest 1762 pass/six skipped; Bun 70 pass; lifecycle audit no violations. |
| Commit/push and independent post-push re-review | pending at batch review | Owned by fix-pr workflow, not established by this local review. |

## Review axes

- Spec/acceptance worst in-scope finding: none in this fix batch. The full fix-pr goal remains partial until push/poll/terminal recording.
- Standards worst finding: no blocker. Separate parallel standards reviewer read `code-review-universal/reference/typescript.md` and diff-relevant duplicate-code guidance. Raw helper export and deletion whitespace nits corrected.
- Standards alleged lost SQL policy detection: refuted, not ignored. Injected queries already pass through production `guardedQuery`; a temporarily gate-denied first SQL statement fails the new semantic error assertion with a policy-denial error. The redundant mock-call assertions are not restored. Native defect probability fell to 0.07 with this runtime evidence; its separate preferred-assertion answer remained uncertain (0.53), so deterministic proof decides.
- Pre-existing CRLF close-writer emits mixed line endings that still parse as completed. No runtime consequence shown; out-of-scope formatting nit, unchanged.
- Cross-axis ranking: none. Local review is not a settlement review.

## Guardrails verdict

Contract durable, version 2, status pass. Unit/global-ratchet/complexity pass; advisory patch gate pass; functional/lint deliberately disabled. Coverage 89.3%, baseline 84%, 30 baseline hotspots with zero new or hard-ceiling violations. Proposed baseline raise not applied. diff-cover reports 94% patch coverage; current runner percentage parser returns null without weakening the threshold.

Final scoped suites after export/whitespace edits: 433 passed/three skipped in five files. Authoritative gate rerun and lifecycle audit also exit zero. Actual scan/diagnosis smoke runs production imports on retired CRLF and active artifacts.

## Documentation and historical evidence

- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` records shared CRLF lifecycle and one canonical directive subject. Machine rollback and docs-verdict comments are accurate.
- No new user-facing action, domain terminology or architecture decision; no new how-to or ADR.
- Historical phase-3 artifacts describing the synthetic legacy fixture are intentionally not rewritten as though it had been valid production proof. This record supersedes that R-1 evidence with actual isolated production-source recovery. The recovery behavior is preserved; no feature/acceptance scope is removed.

## Verdict

Pass for the verified fix batch. No in-plan implementation defect remains. Next: commit/push the green batch, then complete the bounded independent GitHub re-review protocol.
