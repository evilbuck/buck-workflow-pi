# Multi-Harness Symlink Installer

## Goal
One `buck-workflow install` command detects installed agent harnesses and symlinks the bootstrap instructions + skill/command trees into each, so pointing any agent at the package "just works" and updates propagate automatically.

## Artifacts
- [plan-symlink-installer.md](./plan-symlink-installer.md) — bounded implementation plan (status: active)

## Open Questions
- Exact Claude Code skill-loading format (commands confirmed; skills format to verify in build)
- Cursor global User Rules file path (project `.cursor/rules/` confirmed; global uncertain)
- Codex Agent Skills directory convention (bootstrap-only is the safe default)
